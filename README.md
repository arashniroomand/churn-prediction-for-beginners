# 🧠 Churn Prediction (A Beginner’s Deep Learning Project)

This repository presents a **simple yet complete example** of building a **Neural Network** for predicting customer churn.  
It’s designed for beginners who want to **understand the fundamentals of deep learning** using a real-world dataset, without getting lost in complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a **practical learning guide**, showing how to:
- Load and explore data  
- Preprocess and encode features  
- Build, train, and evaluate a neural network  
- Save and reload the trained model  

By following this notebook, you’ll gain hands-on experience in creating a full machine learning workflow, from raw data to a deployable model.

## 📁 Folders Structure

``` bash
├── src/
│   ├── churn_notebook.ipynb   # Main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step explanations
├── model              # Folder for saved model and scaler
│
├── README.md

````

All main code and detailed explanations are inside the **`src`** folder.  
Each cell in the notebook includes clear explanations to help you understand how every step works.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and evaluation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arashniroomand/DeepLearningPlayBook.git
   cd Churn Prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook:

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Churn_Modelling.csv** dataset, which you can download from Kaggle:

🔗 [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling)

After downloading, place the file inside the `src/` folder before running the notebook.


## 💡 What You’ll Learn

* Understanding dataset structure and target variable
* Visualizing data and identifying class imbalance
* Performing feature encoding and scaling
* Designing a neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
* Using callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau)
* Evaluating model accuracy and generating reports
* Saving and loading trained models

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This notebook is not meant to build a production-grade model.
Instead, it serves as a **learning resource** for those taking their first steps into deep learning,
a practical starting point to understand how models learn, perform, and get stored for reuse.
